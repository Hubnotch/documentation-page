          Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that runs on the server.
Node.js is open source, cross-platform, and since its introduction in 2009, it got hugely popular
and now plays a significant role in the web development scene. If GitHub stars are one
popularity indication factor, having 46000+ stars means being very popular.

          Node.js can be installed in different ways. This post highlights the most common and
convenient ones.</p>
<p> Official packages for all the major platforms are available at https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager. In this case, every
operating system has its own.
</p>
<p>On macOS, Homebrew is the de-facto standard, and - once installed - allows to install Node.js
very easily, by running this command in the CLI:
        </p>
        <code>
          brew install node
        </code>
  <p>
    Other package managers for Linux and Windows are listed in
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/</p>
<p>
nvm is a popular way to run Node. It allows you to easily switch the Node version, and install
new versions to try and easily rollback if something breaks, for example.
It is also very useful to test your code with old Node versions.
</p>
<p>
See https://github.com/creationix/nvm for more information about this option.
My suggestion is to use the official installer if you are just starting out and you don't use
Homebrew already, otherwise, Homebrew is my favorite solution.
In any case, when Node is installed you'll have access to the node executable program in the
command line.

          If you are just starting out with JavaScript, how much deeply do you need to
know the language?
        </p>
        <p>
As a beginner, it's hard to get to a point where you are confident enough in your programming
abilities.</p>
<p>
While learning to code, you might also be confused at where does JavaScript end, and where
Node.js begins, and vice versa.
I would recommend you to have a good grasp of the main JavaScript concepts before diving
into Node.js:

      <article>
        The usual way to run a Node program is to call the node globally available command (once
you install Node) and pass the name of the file you want to execute.
If your main Node application file is in app. j s , you can call it by typing
        <code>
        node app. j s
        </code>

      <header>How to read environment variables</header>
      <p>
        The process core module of Node provides the env property which hosts all the
        environment variables that were set at the moment the process was started.
        Here is an example that accesses the NODE_ENV environment variable, which is set to
        development by default.
      </p>
      <code>
        process. env. NODE_ENV // "development"
      </code>
      <p>
        Setting it to "production" before the script runs will tell Node that this is a production
environment.
In the same way you can access any custom environment variable you set.

    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
      <header>Pass arguments from the command line</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You can pass any number of arguments when invoking a Node.js application using
        </p>
        <code>
          node app. j s
        </code>
        <p>
          Arguments can be standalone or have a key and a value.
For example:
        </p>
        <code>node app. j s Ekene</code>
        <p>
          This changes how you will retrieve this value in the Node code.
          The way you retrieve it is using the process object built into Node.
          It exposes an argv property, which is an array that contains all the command line invocation
          arguments.
          The first argument is the full path of the node command.
          The second element is the full path of the file being executed.
          All the additional arguments are present from the third position going forward.
          You can iterate over all the arguments (including the node path and the file path) using a loop
        </p>
  
        <code>
          process. argv. forEach( ( val, index) => {
            console. log( ` ${index}: ${val}` )
            })
        </code>
        <p>
          You can get only the additional arguments by creating a new array that excludes the first 2
params:
        </p>
<code>
  const args = process. argv. slice( 2)
</code>

<p>
  If you have one argument without an index name, like this:
</p>
<code>node app. j s Ekene</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
      <header>Global variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
          frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
          name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
          document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
          parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
  
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
          variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
          represent a variable.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
          variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>
  
        <code
          >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
          CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
          }</code
        >
        However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
        is executed without problems.
        <code
          >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
      <header>Data types</header>
      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>
                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                other variant.
              </li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>
                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                unique and immutable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
  
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
        to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
        are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
        objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
        your application can perform.

    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
        is false. An if statement looks as follows:
  
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
        including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code
          >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
          } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
        </code>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
        evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
        them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
  
        <code
          >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
        >
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
        because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
        the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
        assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
        additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
  
        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
        evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
  
        <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
        statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
        statement following the loop.
  
        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
          the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
          control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
          those statements.
        </p>
  
        Example:
  
        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
  
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article>
        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
  
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
            brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
        </p>
  
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
          the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
          the calling function.
